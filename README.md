Summer of Making: Grand Expedition - The Opinion Dominion (Scene 18)
# Idea
When you first go to the page, you will be asked to give Dave the Magical Wizard a question. Once inputed, he says "didnt ask lmao" and invites you to their crib.

The crib will have a small QnA about himself, aswell as a chat board, with the last 10 questions that were given to him (if i can, i could make a small webserver that stores all the questions, and use web requests to gain them - otherwise, i will just provide 10 random questions, including the users).

At the bottom, you can click on the wizard and he will provide random responces.

At the VERY bottom, you can choose where to go next.
