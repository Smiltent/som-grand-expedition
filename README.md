# The Opinion Dominion
Summer of Making: Grand Expedition - The Opinion Dominion (Scene 18)

# Idea
You go to the Opinion Dominion area, you are greeted by Dave. Dave will "answer" any question you ask
# Areas
## 1. The Crib
There you can meet the Wizard and click on him with texts.
## 2. Basement
A bulletin board with the information about the Scene & accessing other Scenes.  
## 3. Unstable Crystal
Can be found by going to the Basement and clicking the ? Book, causing you to be teleported in the area.  
When clicked multiple times, you break it and it explodes, causing you to die (aka, the page closes).  
When the user comes back to the scene, the wizard will remember you and ask why you broke the crystal.  
The book will no longer be clickable next time you go to the basement.
# Scrapped Ideas
1. The last 10 questions get sent to my servers and will be showed in some sort of "leaderboard" - Scrapped as outside pings aren't allowed
